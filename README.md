# Sigma 0.0.1-alpha

The world's biggest chad design tool. Started with a jQuery clone, now we're here. Straigh up jumping into developing design tools.

This project aims to create a working, small scale web design tool similar to Figma, Sketch, Zeplin or Adobe XD. As usual, the main focus is to learn and try to develop this into an actual usable application.
